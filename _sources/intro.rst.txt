Introduction
============

Free energy minimization (FEM) is a method for learning from data the probability distribution :math:`p`, with a form inspired by statistical physics, of an output variable :math:`y` given input variables :math:`x_i`. We use :math:`p` to both 1) understand the relations among the data variables :math:`x_i,y`, for example, to identify pairs or groups of variables that vary together and 2) to predict the output given new inputs. We are actively developing variations of the method that are conducive to modeling different types of data.
