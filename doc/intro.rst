Introduction
============

Free energy minimization (FEM) is a method for learning from data a nonlinear function :math:`f`, with a form inspired by statistical physics, that maps input variables :math:`x_i` to an output variable :math:`y`. We use :math:`f` to both 1) understand the relations among the data variables :math:`x_i,y`, for example, to identify pairs or groups of variables that vary together and 2) to predict the value of the output variable given the values of the input variables. We are actively developing variations of the method that are conducive to modeling different types of data.
